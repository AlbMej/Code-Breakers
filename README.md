# A fun interactive coding activity for high school students

## Overview 

*This project is designed to be completed within 3 days by high school students without prior coding experience*

**How is this done?** 
Students are briefly taught about programming in Python, and then debriefed on the project.
The goal is for the students to first understand the problem at a theoretical level. 
After that, they can begin brainstorming ways to tackle the project pragmatically.

Once they are done brainstorming, they are given code that is mostly complete with the expection 
of a few blanks. This is meant to guide the students with the implementation of the problem.

**Why is this done?** 
The reason for this approach is to help high school students visualize the way coding can
be used in real time applications. The way this project is structured gives the students a 
linear direction to take in order to solve it. The problem given forces them to think 
about the problem first, and then to find ways to implement their reasoning in Python.
