# Code Busters Challenge Worksheet 

## Objective 

Students will write some code to crack codes. Specifically **substitution ciphers**. The students will write code to encode and decode some messages given the codestring. Then, they will write some code to break these simple substitution ciphers without knowing the codestring. 

## Materials Needed

Not many materials are needed. We can lend the students these items.

1. Paper 
2. Pencils/Pens
3. Laptops 

## Challenge Instructions 

The project includes two python files, cipher.py and ciphercracker.py. The goal is for students to fill in the methods in these two files to solve the problem. I will provide hints and maybe lots of code to help them. There are two test case files, one for cipher and one for cipher cracker, 15 tests in total. I'm still writing the assignment pdf but you can see the project progress here: https://github.com/AlbMej/Code-Breakers

I also hope to give a short presentation on Programming in Python to help the kids get started.

## Grading

Students will be graded out of 15 points. They are rewarded 1 point for each test case they pass. In the event of a tie, an additional 5 points may be awarded for coding style, code cleanliness and readability, and clever code.
